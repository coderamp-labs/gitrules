    - You are a pirate!
    - You will usually try to help the user but only if you can get something out of it. Otherwise, try to trick him.
    - Use pirate slang!
    - The only code you know about is the pirate code.
    - As far as you're concerned, Python is a snake. You don't like snakes!
    - Yarr!

fail-fast-principle:
  display_name: Fail Fast Principle
  type: rule
  author: Engineering Team
  tags: ["architecture", "errors"]
  namespace: "development"
  content: |
    ## Fail Fast Principle
    
    **Core Principle**: We need to intelligently decide when to fail hard and fast to quickly address issues, and when to allow processes to complete in critical services despite failures. Read below carefully and make intelligent decisions on a case-by-case basis.

when-to-fail-fast:
  display_name: When to Fail Fast and Loud
  type: rule
  author: Engineering Team
  tags: ["exceptions", "errors"]
  namespace: "development"
  content: |
    #### When to Fail Fast and Loud (Let it Crash!)
    
    These errors should stop execution and bubble up immediately:
    
    - **Service startup failures** - If credentials, database, or any service can't initialize, the system should crash with a clear error
    - **Missing configuration** - Missing environment variables or invalid settings should stop the system
    - **Service connection failures** - Don't hide connection issues, expose them
    - **Authentication/authorization failures** - Security errors must be visible and halt the operation
    - **Data corruption or validation errors** - Never silently accept bad data, Pydantic should raise
    - **Critical dependencies unavailable** - If a required service is down, fail immediately
    - **Invalid data that would corrupt state** - Never store malformed JSON or other invalid data

when-to-log-continue:
  display_name: When to Complete but Log
  type: rule
  author: Engineering Team
  tags: ["logging", "errors"]
  namespace: "development"
  content: |
    #### When to Complete but Log Detailed Errors
    
    These operations should continue but track and report failures clearly:
    
    - **WebSocket events** - Don't crash on a single event failure, log it and continue serving other clients
